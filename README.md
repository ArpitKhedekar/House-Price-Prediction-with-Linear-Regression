# House-Prices-Prediction-with-Linear-Regression
In this assignment, we're  going to predict the price of a house using information like its location, area, no. of rooms etc. We'll use the dataset from the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle. We'll follow a step-by-step process to train our model:

1. Download and explore the data
2. Prepare the dataset for training
3. Train a linear regression model
4. Make predictions and evaluate the model
